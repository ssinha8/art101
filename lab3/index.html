		<h1>Lab 3: File Structure</h1>

		<p>The objective of this lab was to create a local file structure on my device
		and add html files to all the labs that are linked to from my <a href="https://ssinha8.github.io/art101/">homepage</a>.</p>

		<h2>Challenges</h2>

		<p>There were really no challenges in this lab. I was comfortable following
			the directions provided. The closest thing to a challenge was stylizing
			the <a href="https://ssinha8.github.io/art101/">homepage</a> due to the
			amount of time it took to make it to my liking.<p>

		<h2>Results</h2>

		<p>This page is the index file created for Lab3. The other index files for
			all future labs are currently blank. This is the local file structure as
			shown in Atom, the text editor:</p>
		<img src="img/fileStructure.png" width=1200px>
		<p>The following images are the HTML source code of Lab 3 and the way it
			looks in a browser:</p>
		<img src="img/lab3file.jpg" width=1200px>
		<img src="img/lab3site.jpg" width=1200px>
		<p>The following images are the HTML source code of the <a href="https://ssinha8.github.io/art101/">homepage</a> and the way it
