		<h1>Lab 4: File Transfer</h1>

		<p>The objective of this lab was to get in the mindset of programming and begin pseudocoding.</p>

		<h2>Challenges</h2>

		<p>There were really no challenges in this lab. I was comfortable following
			the directions provided. The closest thing to a challenge was brainstorming what activity to pseudocode.<p>

		<h2>Problems</h2>

		<p>Since there wasn't a challenging part of this lab for me, I didn't run into any problems.
			Again, the closest thing to a problem was brainstorming what activity to pseudocode.<p>

		<h3>Results</h3>

		<p>Outline of the everyday task of getting food:</p>
		<pre><code>

				//go to grocery store or order food
			//else:
				//eat
		</pre></code>
		<p>Outline of the computer task:</p>
		<pre><code>
		// Creating a to-do list:
			// Print out the list
			// Accept user input
			// If input is add item, add item to list
			// if input is cross item, cross out item on list
			// If input is remove item, remove item from list
			// Update list and go back to top
		</pre></code>
