			<h2>Challenge</h2>

			<p>The objective of this lab was to use a for loop inside of the function
				FizzBuzz() to loop through numbers 1-200 and then print Fizz, Buzz, Boom
				or a combination of the three based on the factors of the number. If 3 was
			 	a factor, Fizz is printed. If 5 is a factor, then Buzz is printed. If 7
				is a factor, then Boom is printed.</p>
