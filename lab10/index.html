		<h1>Lab 10: JavaScript Events and Forms</h1>

		<h2>Challenge</h2>

		<p>The objective of this lab was to use JavaScript events and forms to take input
			from the user and apply some function to the value of the input that would output
			a result that has to be added to the HTML page. In my case, I used the nameSorted
			function from Lab 7. So, the site takes a user-inputted name and sorts the letters
			after the button saying 'Click me' is clicked on using JS Event logic. The result is
			outputted under the Results section below. </p>

		<h2>Problems</h2>

		<p>I didn't run into any problems. I found the lab instructions to be
      straightforward and easy to follow.<p>

		<h2>Results</h2>

		<p>This is the index.html file produced for Lab 10. Click
			<a href="js/lab.js">here</a> to go to the JavaScript file. Below is the
			button and text-field to enter your name. Upon clicking the button, your
			sorted name will appear below:</p>

			<label for="user-name">Input your name: </label><br>
			<input type="text" id="user-name"><br>
			<button id="my-button">Click me!</button>
		<div id="output">
			<p>Sorted name: </p>
		</div>
