		<h1>Lab 8: Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>

		<h2>Challenge</h2>

		<p>The objective of this lab was to experiment with anonymous functions
     and callbacks. The idea was to create a function that took a single number
     parameter and did some calculations with it. Then array.map was used on an
     array of numbers alongside that function as a callback.</p>

		<h2>Problems</h2>

		<p>I didn't run into any problems.</p>

		<h2>Results</h2>

    <p>Go to the console to see the results.</p>
